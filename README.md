# Sandwich-Ordering-System-
A self-ordering kiosk system, Sandwich Ordering System is developed with C++ for the owner of a sandwich shop to carry out the business’s operation in a smooth and effective manner. This system is able to help every owner of food business to manage the information in food ordering process including item category, type of food, payment method and so on in a systematic way.

In using this system, there are options “Our Sandwich” and “Make Your Own Sandwich” which allow the users to either order a standardized sandwich or custom made sandwich. Other than that, this system has been set to have beverages for customers to mix with sandwich. Next, the users are able to add on, make payment and view receipt through this system. It also allows the users to make changes or add on after they have made their choices.
